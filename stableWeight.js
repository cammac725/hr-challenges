/* Here is a simple task.Take an array / tuple of unique positive integers, and two additional positive integers.Here's an example below:

const arr = [3, 5, 7, 1, 6, 8, 2, 4];
const n = 3; // span length
const q = 13; // weight threshold
Try to re - arrange arr so that the sum of any n consecutive values does not exceed q.

    solver(arr, n, q); // one possible solution: [4,7,1,5,6,2,3,8]
