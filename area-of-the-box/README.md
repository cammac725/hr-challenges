# Area of the Box

## Given a box of chocolate bars of dimension N x M, choose an area a x a such that for all a, 1 <= a <= min(N, M). Given multiple values of N and M, find the number of ways to choose the area of dimension a x a from the box of dimension NxM for all a.

## For example, given a box of bars where N = 2 and M = 2, there is one way to have a 2 x 2 bar, and there are 4 wyas to choose a 1 x 1 bar. In this case, the number of ways to choose a x a bars for all valid values of a is 5.
